# Pokémon Core Battle Sys

## Description:
This is a simple text-based Pokémon battle simulator implemented in Python. It allows you to simulate battles between two Pokémon: Pikachu and Charmander. Each Pokémon has two moves with different damage and chances of success. The battle continues until one of the Pokémon's HP reaches zero.

## How to Use:
1. Run the Python script `Pokemon Project.py`.
2. Follow the prompts to choose moves for Pikachu and Charmander.
3. The battle will proceed turn by turn, displaying the damage dealt and the remaining HP of each Pokémon.
4. The battle ends when one Pokémon's HP drops to zero.

## Moves:
### Charmander's Moves:
1. FireBall:
   - Damage: 30
   - Chance of Success: 50%

2. FireTunnel:
   - Damage: 70
   - Chance of Success: 43%

### Pikachu's Moves:
1. Eltracute:
   - Damage: 40
   - Chance of Success: 89%

## How the Battle Works:
- Each turn, you will be prompted to choose a move for either Pikachu or Charmander.
- The chosen move's success is determined randomly based on the move's chance of success.
- If the move is successful, it deals damage to the opponent's HP.
- The battle continues until one of the Pokémon's HP reaches zero.

## Additional Notes:
- If you enter an invalid move, you'll be prompted to choose again.
- The battle outputs messages indicating the damage dealt and the remaining HP of each Pokémon.
- The battle ends when one Pokémon's HP drops to zero, and the winner is declared.

Enjoy your Pokémon battle experience!
